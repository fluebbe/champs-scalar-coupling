# Kaggle competition: Predicting Molecular Properties

This is our solution to CHAMPS (CHemistry And Mathematics in Phase Space))
[Scalar Coupling challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/).
We finished on rank 24 with our team 'haha nice'. A short description of our
method can be found
[here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling/discussion/106404). In
[notebooks/usage.ipynb](notebooks/usage.ipynb) we show how to use our model.
